## General info

**STATUS: WIP**

**Sudoku** (数独, sūdoku, digit-single) (_/suːˈdoʊkuː, -ˈdɒk-, sə-/_, originally called **Number Place**) is a logic-based, [combinatorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics) number-placement [puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle). In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called _boxes_, _blocks_, or _regions_) contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

French newspapers featured variations of the Sudoku puzzles in the 19th century, and the puzzle has appeared since 1979 in [puzzle books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_book) under the name Number Place. However, the modern Sudoku only began to gain widespread popularity in 1986 when it was published by the Japanese puzzle company [Nikoli](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikoli_(publisher)>) under the name Sudoku, meaning _single number_. It first appeared in a U.S. newspaper, and then [The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times) (London), in 2004, thanks to the efforts of [Wayne Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gould), who devised a [computer program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) to rapidly produce unique puzzles.
